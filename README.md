## Trading Strategies
### Moving Average
The moving average strategy helps identify trends by smoothing out price data. You can set the short-term and long-term moving averages to generate buy and sell signals.

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
The RSI strategy uses momentum indicators to determine overbought or oversold conditions. Set your RSI thresholds to trigger trades based on market conditions.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
The MACD strategy involves using two moving averages to identify potential buy and sell points. Customize your MACD settings in the configuration file.
